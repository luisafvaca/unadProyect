                            HTML is considered a markup language this means that it has a system that allows building a web structure by tags. Those tags have different uses, depending on the context and the things that we need to do, the most popular tag are div, section, articles, anchors, forms, list and meta tags.
But it is not everything about HTML, in the latter html's versions four powerful technologies was included, < canvas >, < svg >, < audio > and < video >

                            The CSS abbreviation means cascading styles sheet, so this provides an idea about what's the CSS's role into the web. At moment, web pages and web apps look for innovations with designs the same as magazines, book, and publicity.

                            Javascript is an interpreted language, we can find different discussions about if it is compiled or not, by my position this language is compiled in thousandths of a seconds for the browser. To other side, it doesn't need to be installed, we can use it on the browser, just opening the dev tools on the user agents.
                            Javascript it's easy, and currently is being used by multiples libraries and frameworks like React.js, it means that the language it dynamic and powerful and like others have an inheritance system.
